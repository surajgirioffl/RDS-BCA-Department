                  Method 1 is default method. If you want to change the method, then enter 3 in main menu.
                  If you select anything other than 1 then method 2 will be used.
                  It is recommended to use method 1 because
                        - file id is one side (right) and other side is the query parameters for download(left).
                        - It is easy to understand.
